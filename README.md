🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning 📊🤖
This project aims to build a simple yet effective machine learning model that can predict a person’s medical insurance cost based on factors like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

✨ About the Project
Healthcare costs can vary a lot from person to person. Insurance companies often use statistical models to estimate how much they might need to charge someone for medical insurance. In this project, we use Python and popular ML libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to:

Analyze the data 🗂️

Visualize important patterns 📈

Train a regression model to predict costs 💵

Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions ✅

📌 Key Features
Clean and preprocess real-world insurance data

Explore how different features (like smoking or BMI) affect cost

Use Linear Regression or other regression algorithms

Predict insurance charges for new data

Easy-to-understand code and visualizations

🎯 Goal
By the end of this project, you’ll understand how to build and test a regression model for predicting continuous values and gain insights into how different factors influence medical expenses.
